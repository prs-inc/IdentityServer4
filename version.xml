       * The product@version is how the Release as a whole is known to the business
       * The source is used to lookup what branch and revision this version was created from
       * The file@revision is really the build counter for this Release.  There are scripts
         in buildserver-utils ps1 files that use the <file> element otherwise it would be 
         renamed to <build>.
       * The file@date is used to build up the alpha build number for nuget packages and 
         the FileInfo.Revision value for the version of the file in the MSI database.
